## Terms and Conditions

By accessing or using **Invento**, you agree to the following terms and conditions. **Invento** is an offline inventory management application designed for the general public. Users can input basic details, such as their name and phone number, which are stored locally on their device. This information is not verified, shared, or used for any other purposes.

As **Invento** operates completely offline, all user data is stored locally on the device. If the app is uninstalled, all stored data will be permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.

Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting your personal information. **Invento** operates entirely offline, and the app collects minimal data such as your name and phone number (optional), which is stored locally on your device. This information is solely used to enhance your inventory management experience and is never shared, processed, or transmitted to external servers or third parties.

Since all data is stored offline, **Invento** does not back up or store your data elsewhere. If you uninstall the app, all your data will be permanently lost. While we take steps to ensure data security, the safety of your information also depends on how you secure your device.
